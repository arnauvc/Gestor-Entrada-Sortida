Just a simple "save and load" library for my neural nets. Template style for the chills.

The library itself is the .hh file. 
The test.cc it's just a validation file. If done properly you should see the following:

Numeros
0
1
2
3
4

Meaning it has stored the set of number called "Numeros" in a file called Estat.txt, and later on it has loaded the set reading from the file and dumping it up in the standard output channel
